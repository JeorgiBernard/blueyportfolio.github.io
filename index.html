                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Bluey! I’m a six-year-old Blue Heeler pup who loves playing and using my imagination to go on fun adventures. I live in Australia with my dad, Bandit; my mum, Chilli; and my little sister, Bingo. I’m always bursting with energy and curiosity, which means I’m usually the one coming up with games and ideas that turn our home into a world of endless possibilities. Whether it’s playing “Keepy Uppy,” pretending to be a doctor, or going on make-believe trips, I love spending time with my family and friends, learning new things, and having fun together!</p>
